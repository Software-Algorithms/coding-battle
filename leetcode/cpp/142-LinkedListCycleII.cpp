// Conclusion:
//
// For better understanding why they meet in the entering point of the loop:
//
// 1. In the first step, slow pointer moves one step a time, and fast pointer moves two step a time, so when the
//    meet, we have
//        2x - x = n k
//        x = n k
//    where x is the steps taken by the slow pointer, n is an integer, k is the number of steps for a full circle
// 2. Now the current position of the two pointer is x, and its distance to the origin is also x = nk. This means
//    if a pointer takes one step each time from origin, and another pointer takes one step each time from x, their
//    distance will be x - 0 = nk, hence they will definitely meet.
// 3. Where will they meet? The answer is simple: they will meet as long as the first pointer enters the loop, then
//    they overlap forever. Image we "roll" the path before the loop onto the loop, then the origin should be at 
//    exactly the same location as the meet point, because x - 0 = nk. These two pointers are always located at the
//    same angle and will see each other when both of them enter the loop.
